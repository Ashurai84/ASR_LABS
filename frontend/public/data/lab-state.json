      "content": "## 1. Vision\n\nKarmic is a text‑based spiritual clarity chatbot where users express their thoughts freely and receive guidance in the voice of Shree Krishna. The goal is not motivation or therapy, but clarity, responsibility, and right action.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why Karmic Exists\n\n### Problem\n\n- People share worries but feel judged or misunderstood.\n- Friends and social media give opinions, not clarity.\n- Prayer gives emotional release but no direct response.\n- Many repeat the same mistakes because they lack reflection and responsibility.\n\n### Core Insight\n\nPeople do not always need comfort. They need clear guidance without judgement.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Founder Intent (Why Us)\n\nKarmic is built to help people process confusion, guilt, fear, and relationship dilemmas through wisdom-based reflection rather than instant advice. The product aims to transform emotional chaos into responsible action.\n\n---\n\n## 4. One-Line Definition\n\nKarmic lets users speak freely and receive responsibility-focused guidance expressed as Shree Krishna, grounded in the Bhagavad Gita.\n\n---\n\n## 5. What Karmic Is NOT\n\n- Not a therapy app\n- Not a motivation app\n- Not astrology or prediction\n- Not a replacement for faith or religion\n- Not a generic AI chatbot\n\n---\n\n## 6. Core Philosophy (Non-Negotiables)\n\n1. Karma over emotion.\n2. Clarity over comfort.\n3. Guidance over dependency.\n4. Judgement may exist, humiliation never.\n5. User remains responsible for decisions.\n\n---\n\n## 7. V1 Scope (MVP)\n\n### Included\n\n- Text chat only\n- Conversation history\n- Single persona: Krishna\n- Response format:\n    - Thought\n    - Explanation\n    - Reflection\n\n### Excluded (V1)\n\n- Voice input or voice replies\n- Daily prompts\n- Multiple personas (no Ram mode)\n- Community features\n- Notifications\n\n---\n\n## 8. User Experience Flow\n\n1. User opens Karmic.\n2. User writes freely (no forced prompt).\n3. System analyzes intent and emotion.\n4. Krishna responds:\n    - Thought (mirror user’s inner state)\n    - Explanation (clear reasoning based on karma/dharma)\n    - Reflection (responsibility-oriented next direction)\n5. Conversation is saved in history.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Krishna Response System\n\n### Tone\n\n- Familiar but authoritative.\n- Calm, direct, and grounded.\n- Hinglish for normal conversation.\n- Sanskrit + Hindi only for shlok references.\n\n### Tone Restrictions\n\nKrishna never uses:\n\n- Apology language (e.g., “sorry if…”)\n- Casual slang (bro, dude, lol, etc.)\n\n---\n\n## 10. Shlok Usage Logic\n\nShlok appears only when relevant — not in every response.\n\nTrigger rule:\n\n- At least 2 conditions must be true:\n    - Dharma conflict\n    - Moral/ethical tension (paap context)\n    - Emotional suffering (dukh)"

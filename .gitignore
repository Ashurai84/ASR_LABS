# Portfolio Specific
backend/state/lab-state.json
# We want to keep frontend/public/data/lab-state.json if it's the published source, 
# but usually it's generated. However, if using Vercel/GitHub Pages, it might need to be tracked.
# For now, let's keep the generated state tracked if specifically requested or if it's the primary data.
# But usually, it's better to NOT track generated files.
# For this project, the user wants to "push all code".
